# Using Amazon Corretto 21 as the build environment
FROM amazoncorretto:21 AS build

# Grant execution permission to the gradlew script

# Download dependencies separately to leverage Docker layer caching
RUN ./gradlew --no-daemon dependencies

# Copy the source code

# Stage 2: Runtime stage
# Using a lightweight Alpine-based JRE for the final image

# Note: Ensure the JAR filename pattern matches your build/libs output

# We default to 8080 but the app should listen on $PORT
